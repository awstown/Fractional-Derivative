%% Huen's Method Eploration
% This Script is Huen's method it uses a predictor corrector method to
% calculate the y_n+1 using Euler's method and then correcting it. To
% derive it you shove the Euler approxiamtion 



h = 0.1;   % Time step
y0 = 1;    % Initial Condition
T = 6;     % End Point
n = T/h;   % Number of steps
t(1) = 0;  % Initial Conditions
y(1) = y0; 
  for k = 1 : n
       t(k+1) = t(k) + h;
       % solve the implicit equation:
       % y(k+1) = y(k) + h*(-t(k)*y(k)-t(k+1)*y(k+1))
       y(k+1) = y(k)*(1-h*t(k))/(1 + h*t(k+1));  
end
yExact = exp(-t.^2); eLocal = abs(y-yExact);
plot(t,yExact,'r',t,y,'*b',t,eLocal,':g');
